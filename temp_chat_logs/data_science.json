This include: Data Compression, One way to reduce the storage and memory requirements of large data sets is to compress them using algorithms that reduce the size of the files without losing much information. For example, you can use gzip, bzip2, or lzma to compress plain text files, or hdf5, npz, or pickle to compress binary files. Data compression can also speed up the loading and reading of the data, as well as the transfer and backup of the data.",
